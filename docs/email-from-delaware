Subject: Acquiring General Information on a few thousand Delaware entities

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am interested in acquiring contact information for a few
thousand Delaware entities. These information are available
in the General Information Name Search [1], but that is
obviously not the most convenient way to acquire these
information. I have two questions.

First, will the contact information (in particular, the
phone number) for Delaware entities be provided in a Direct
Web Access Service [2]? Based on the Frequently Asked
Questions page [3], I think that Direct Web Access in fact
contains even more information than I am looking for, but
I want to make sure that this is the case before I go down
that route.

Second, I am interested in what limits there are as to how
many entities we may access through the General Information
Name Search. In case the Direct Web Access services don't
provide the information or are too expensive for the project,
I am considering looking up at least a subset through the
General Information Name Search. A person who needed similar
information before told us that there are limits on how many
entities we may access, but I didn't see any note of this
on the website. If such limits exist, could you tell me what
they are?

Thanks

Thomas Levine
