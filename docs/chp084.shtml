This moratorium is effective for any new cluster applications, replications and all previously approved cluster slots.  Any employee completing a cluster that began before May 21 or currently receiving a stipend will continue to receive payment of the appropriate amount for the appropriate duration.  Teachers or specialists who obtained NBTPS or other national certification in another state prior to May 21, 2008, may receive the appropriate stipend upon beginning employment in a Delaware school district.  Any teacher or specialist currently in the process of completing a NBPTS or other national certification as of May 21, 2008 will receive the appropriate supplement when the certification is awarded including certification renewals.  If a participant chooses to pursue NBPTS certification independently during the moratorium period, they will not be eligible for retroactive payments should funding be restored during the certification period but they would be eligible for the supplement for the remainder of the certification.  Any teacher or specialist currently receiving a stipend for a national certification under 14 D. C. § 1305 (l) shall continue to receive it as long as the certification is kept current through the appropriate national organization.</span>

Grant awards shall be for a period of 12 months.  Factors that may be utilized in the evaluation of proposals can be, but are not limited to, the following:  links to Part II discipline funding or other district resources; the use of collaborative partnerships; the relative need of the local school district community; and the recognition within a proposal of the need to provide services to meet the presenting problems of both the child and the family.  To the extent possible, the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families is authorized to pursue Medicaid cost recovery for eligible services provided to Medicaid eligible children.  Funds resulting from these efforts may be used to expand these services with prior approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Controller General.</span>

In addition to the procedure for establishing the allowable cost of a new bus specified above, the Department of Education is requested to structure its bids for buses in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, in such a manner that public school bus contractors will be permitted to purchase buses from the successful lower bidder at the same price as the State of Delaware.  If a contractor elects to purchase a bus at the bid price, the lowest base bid of an awarded contract minus two percent for salvage value will be the allowable cost in subsequent reimbursements to the contractor.</span>

While this program is funded in this manner, the provisions of this section shall be treated as guidance to the districts and charter schools that are recipients of this funding.  However, these funds are subject to the guidelines and reporting requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  DCET shall administer a non-competitive application process to determine grant awards to local school districts and charter schools.  Funds provided by this Act may be used in the following priority order: (1) Supporting the maintenance of existing equipment in the schools either through the use of a full time technology position or contractually, (2) replacement of existing equipment, or (3) such other technology needs as may arise which could improve or enhance the technology capabilities of the district.  To the extent that these funds are used to pay salary expenses, they may only be used for the state share in accordance with the schedules contained in 14 Del. C. c. 13.  Funding will be distributed based on the formula developed and approved by the co-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee in Fiscal Year 2001.  Local districts are encouraged to match their allocation pursuant to the provisions of 14 Del. C. § 1902(b), provided the local match does not exceed those established under 71 Del Laws c. 378.  Beginning in Fiscal Year 2008, the matching provisions provided in this section shall not be interpreted to provide duplicative rate increases.  It shall be the responsibility of the Department of Education to receive and disburse these funds.  The department shall also be charged with the authority to verify the use of the funds and shall require each school district to annually report on expenditures of the funds.</span>

If the actual negotiated or bid costs are lower than the maximum rate specified above, the charter school may keep the difference.  If the charter school includes a fuel adjustment contract provision, the charter school shall be responsible for increased payments to the contractor or it may keep funds taken back from the contractor.</span>

C. § 203, § 604 or any sections of this Act to the contrary, the Christina School District is authorized to operate the Sarah Pyle Academy as a special program and charge tuition for the support of the Academy as provided in 14 Del. C. § 604 during the 2009-2010 school year.  The Academy shall operate as an academic recovery, drop-out prevention pilot at no additional cost to the State.  The students attending this program shall continue to be counted in the enrollment of their regular school, however, the state funding associated with these students as determined by the Secretary of Education shall be utilized by the Sarah Pyle Academy.  This program shall be for the express purpose of providing educational services for students in high school who are no less than 16 years of age, who have less than five credits toward graduation, and have a documented family or personal situation that indicates traditional school enrollment is not feasible.  This program shall not be a discipline program as defined or authorized by 14 Del. C. c. 16. An independent evaluation, with oversight by the Department of Education, shall be conducted at the expense of the Christina School District.  A final report shall be provided to the Secretary of Education, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Controller General, and the Co-Chairs of the Joint Finance Committee by June 15 of each fiscal year.</span>
