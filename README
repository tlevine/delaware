Get Deleware company registration data!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It might be nice if it were easy to get data about company registrations.
People tell me that this is a bit hard in Delaware. While much information
is available through the
`General Information Name Search <https://delecorp.delaware.gov/tin/GINameSearch.jsp>`_
site, a single person is only allowed to make so many requests to the site.
(I'm not sure of the exact number; this is just what other people tell me.)

In order to download all of the data, we are thus getting a bunch of different
people to all download a small piece of the data, staying within the quota that
he or she or ze is allowed. **You can help!**

You just need to install this program and let it keep running. It will
periodically contact a central server for directions, and it will query
Delaware's General Information Name Search accordingly. It does a lot of
things to check that you are staying within your quota and to avoid crashing
Delaware's server.

Installing
==================
Open a terminal. Here are directions for
`Mac <http://www.ehow.com/how_6762372_open-terminal-apple.html>`_ and
`Windows <http://www.ehow.com/how_8128463_open-terminal-session-windows-7.html>`_.
If you are using another operating system, you probably already know how to
open a terminal.

You'll see a block of text like this when you need to type things into the terminal. ::

    When you need to type something into a terminal, it will look like this.

## Installing with Pip
If you already have Python and Pip installed, you can just run this command. ::

    pip install delaware

If that gives you an error about permissions, try this command. ::

    sudo pip install delaware

If that worked, you are **finished** with the installation.

## Installing Python
If that command gave you an error, it's probably because you
don't have ``pip``. If you get an error, run this command to check whether you
have Python installed. ::

    python --version

It should say "Python" and then a version number. If it gives you an error,
follow `these directions <https://www.python.org/download/>`_ to install Python.

At this point, you should have Python installed. 

XXX Add a note about Enthought, Continuum, &c.

## Installing without Pip
Once you have Python installed, (You don't need Pip.) download the package
(I have to make this.) and run the setup like so. ::

    tar xzf delaware.tar.gz
    cd delaware
    sudo python setup.py

(That's three commands, one per line.)

Running
=======================
Once you've installed the program, type this into a terminal. ::

    delaware

It'll ask you a few questions the first time you run it, but you can totally
ignore it after that.

If errors come up
========================
If the program stops running, please send the error message to _@thomaslevine.com.
Also, please save the ``~/.delaware`` directory, as it contains files that can be
helpful for figuring out what went wrong.
