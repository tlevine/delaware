According to [this random webpage](http://blog.delawareinc.com/delaware-state-file-number/),

> The Delaware state file number is the number the state of Delaware issues to each new company at the time of formation. It is formatted with seven numbers. For example, 1234567. Each new Delaware company will be one digit higher than the company before it. It is the number that you can use to identify your company when dealing with the Delaware secretary of state.

Thus, I think "File Number" is a decent way to look up companies.
