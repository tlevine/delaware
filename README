Get Deleware company registration data!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It might be nice if it were easy to get data about company registrations.
People tell me that this is a bit hard in Delaware. While much information
is available through the
`General Information Name Search <https://delecorp.delaware.gov/tin/GINameSearch.jsp>`_
site, a single person is only allowed to make so many requests to the site.
(I'm not sure of the exact number; this is just what other people tell me.)

In order to download all of the data, we are thus getting a bunch of different
people to all download a small piece of the data, staying within the quota that
he or she or ze is allowed. **You can help!**

You just need to install this program and let it keep running. It will
periodically contact a central server for directions, and it will query
Delaware's General Information Name Search accordingly. It does a lot of
things to check that you are staying within your quota and to avoid crashing
Delaware's server.

Installing
==================
Two ways of installing are explained below.

Standalone installation
    For most people
Installing with Pip
    For people who know what Python and Pip and terminals are

Standalone installation
--------------------------
I am going to make a package with `PyInstaller <http://www.pyinstaller.org/>`_
and put directions here as to how to install it. So this installation method
isn't available yet.

Installing with Pip
---------------------
If you are used to using a terminal and already have Python and Pip installed,
you can just run this command. ::

    pip install delaware

If that gives you an error about permissions, try this command. ::

    sudo pip install delaware

Running
=======================
Once you've installed the program, type this into a terminal. ::

    delaware

It'll ask you a few questions the first time you run it, but you can totally
ignore it after that.

If errors come up
========================
If the program stops running, please send the error message to
_@thomaslevine.com. Also, please don't delete the ``~/.delaware`` directory,
as it contains files that can be helpful for figuring out what went wrong.
