Still nobody has downloaded the Deleware corporations registry,
as far as I can tell.

This might contain some juicy information on all of the companies
who register there for the tax benefits. Wanna help me get this?

## The help I want
It's hard because they block IP addresses pretty quickly. I don't
know how quickly, but I'll figure that out. So I'm writing something
in the style of Folding at Home in order to have access to lots of
IP addresses.

This involves some coordination among computers, and I don't trust
myself to do that very well. The simplest thing is to have everything
contact one central manager, and I don't trust myself to keep that
manager from crashing. A fancier thing would be a socialist peer-to-peer
thing where the workers also manage the means of production, and I
don't trust myself to write that well.

Also, if you've already played with this site and know something about
the errors it gives or the methods of blocking, that would be helpful.

## Technical details
I'm writing the worker in Python because it comes installed on
most POSIX systems and because this,

but the server could be written in something else.
