You are running a program that searches for data on companies registered
in the State of Deleware.

==============================
What it does
==============================
It contacts Tom's (http://dada.pink) server for directions, queries the
General Information Name Search directions, queries the General Information
Name Search (https://delecorp.delaware.gov/tin/GINameSearch.jsp) accordingly,
and sends the results to Tom's server. This will all happen without any
effort from you as long as you keep the program running.

==============================
Licensing
==============================
Your computer will collect data and send them to Tom, and Tom is going to
redistribute the data under the Open Data Commons Open Database License
(http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/).

==============================
How Delaware might react
==============================
Tom would like you to know that Delaware might get annoyed at you for running
this program. Tom heard from other people that this website bans IP addresses
after they have made a few hundred requests per day. He is skeptical that the
limit is actually this low, but the point is that you might get banned from the
website. (He asked the Division of Corporations about, and their response to
this question was not helpful.)

Also, he has heard that Delaware sends scary letters to people who use this
website, so they might send you one.

==============================
Why access the data this way
==============================
It would be nice if there were a better way to get these data. Tom heard that
the Division of Corporations is exempt from freedom of information law, but
it might be worth looking further into that avenue.

It may be that some companies (http://corp.delaware.gov/directwebvend.shtml)
can sell you the data, but Tom isn't sure; he contacted the Delaware
Division of Corporations for information about this, and the response
wasn't helpful.

If you have any ideas on other ways of getting the company registration
information, Tom would love to know.

==============================
Is all this okay?
==============================
Is it okay that Tom is going to release the data under the Open Data Commons
Open Database License and that Delaware might get annoyed at you?

If so, type "yes"; if not, hit ctrl+C to exit the program.

You need to type "yes" to run the software. If you are not okay with how
Delaware might react or how Tom would redistribute the data, hit ctrl+c.
